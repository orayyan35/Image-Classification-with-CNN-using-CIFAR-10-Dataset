 image Classification with CNN  

### Project Description: Image Classification using CNN and CIFAR-10 Dataset

#### 1. **Project Overview:**
This project aims to build a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different categories. The categories are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

#### 2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset:**
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

#### 3. **Building the Model:**
We use the Keras library to build a CNN model. The architecture typically involves several convolutional layers, each followed by a pooling layer, and then a few dense (fully connected) layers. The final layer uses softmax activation to output probabilities for each of the 10 classes.

#### 4. **Training the Model:**
The model is trained on the training dataset, where the images are fed into the network, and the corresponding labels are used to calculate the loss. The optimizer adjusts the weights to minimize the loss over several epochs.

#### 5. **Evaluating the Model:**
After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to check its performance. Metrics such as accuracy and loss are used to assess how well the model has learned to classify the images.

#### 6. **Prediction:**
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on new images. Given an input image, the model preprocesses it, feeds it through the network, and outputs the predicted class.

#### 7. **Visualization:**
The predictions can be visualized by displaying the input image along with the predicted class label. This helps in understanding how the model is performing on individual samples.

This project showcases the process of building, training, and deploying a CNN model for image classification, and it highlights the practical applications of deep learning in computer vision tasks.
